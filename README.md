ABSTRACT:Underwater object detection presents unique challenges due to limited visibility, variable lighting conditions, and the complex nature of aquatic environments. In this study, we propose an innovative underwater object detection system that combines user input, real-time camera feedback, and analysis of a pre-existing dataset to enhance detection accuracy and efficiency. The system begins by accepting user input, which provides context and specific search criteria for the detection process. This input may include target object descriptions, location details, or any other relevant information. Concurrently, the system utilizes an underwater camera to capture live footage of the underwater environment. Using advanced computer vision algorithms, the camera feed is analyzed in real-time to detect potential objects matching the user's criteria. Simultaneously, the system references a comprehensive dataset containing annotated underwater images to further refine the detection process. Machine learning techniques, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), are employed to leverage the dataset for improved object recognition. Integration of user input, camera feedback, and dataset analysis enables the system to adapt dynamically to changing conditions and user requirements. Detected objects are categorized and presented to the user, along with relevant information such as size, distance, and confidence level. The proposed system offers several advantages, including enhanced detection accuracy, reduced false positives, and improved user interaction. By harnessing the power of real-time feedback and machine learning, it addresses the challenges inherent in underwater object detection, facilitating applications in marine research, underwater exploration, and environmental monitoring. This project uses image processing and machine learning techniques for object detection. This project proposes a novel approach leveraging deep learning techniques for accurate and efficient detection of underwaterobject.
